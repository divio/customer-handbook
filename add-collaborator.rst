How to add and manage collaborators
====================================

Divio allows you to manage projects and collaborators using organisations. An organisation is free to create, and you
may add and manage developers, even customers with varying access levels, as collaborators as many as you need.

Collaborator types
------------------

* *Owner* collaborator set by default upon creation of the organisation and has full control over the organisation, all
  its projects and collaborators.
* *Administrator* collaborators will have access to the organisation and all projects in it.  
* *Regular* collaborators will not have access to projects in the organisation until they are explicitly given
  access through adding projects they should have access to. 

Add a collaborator to an organisation
--------------------------------------

* Select the organisation to which you would like to add the collaborator.
* From the organisations *settings*, select *collaborators* and *add collaborators*. 
* Add your collaboratorâ€™s email address and select whether you want to provide *regular* or *administrator*
  permissions. Your new collaborator will receive a confirmation email and will need to verify their account. 

If the collaborator you invite does not have a Divio account, they will have the option to create one. The email address
you use to invite a collaborator must match their account email address.

Until the account is confirmed by your collaborator, you will see a *pending*  status attached to the new user.

Your new collaborator is now a member of the organisation. 


Add a collaborator to a project
-------------------------------

A collaborator to be added to a project must be a member of the organisation the project belongs to. 

In the project's Dashboard, select *collaborators* and add a collaborator from the list of collaborators in the
organisation to the project.


Remove collaborators
--------------------

To remove a collaborator from an organisation, in the organisation settings, select collaborators, and click the options
menu for a particular collaborator and select *remove*.

To remove a collaborator from a project, in the project's Dashboard, select *collaborators*, and click the options menu
for a particular collaborator and select *remove*.
