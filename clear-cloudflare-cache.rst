How to clear the Cloudflare CDN cache
=====================================

If your project uses Cloudflare CDN caching, you can clear it as required via our control panel. 

.. note:: 

    This is only available if: 
    
    * your project uses Cloudflare's CDN 
    * the Cloudflare CDN was set up by Divio, and not independently

To clear the cache for a domain on your project, go to its *Domains* view and *select* the domain for which you need to clear the cache. 

The cache will be cleared within a few minutes, and you will see a success message in the dashboard.
