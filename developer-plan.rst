The Developer plan
===================

You can start a free Developer subscription for any Divio project. 
The Developer plan is ideal for:

* working on a project until you are ready to go live under a paid subscription
* exploring the platform and discovering its features and capabilities
* small personal projects

To make it as useful as possible, the Developer plan includes a rich set of features. 
For example, a project in the developer plan 

* can launch a live project even with your own domains. 
* runs indefinitely - there is no time limit on the subscription.

Developer plan limitations
--------------------------

Limitations of the Developer plan are:

* technical support is strictly limited
* the project gets deleted, if the account owner does not log in for 60 days,
* after 30 minutes inactivity, the Live container sleeps, resulting in a short delay in waking up
* some additional services cannot be selected

Upgrading to a paid plan
------------------------

As the developer plan is not intended for production, once you are ready to launch your project live, 
it is highly recommended to subscribe to a paid plan. For this,

* you can subscribe from your project's *Subscription* view. 

If you have any questions regarding subscription, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us.
