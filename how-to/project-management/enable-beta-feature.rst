How to enable access to beta features
=====================================

Divio is always evolving and new releases are coming out consistently. 
Enabling the beta features provides you with an early access to the latest releases 
tested and approved by our team to be tried out by customers. 
 
To opt-in to a beta feature

* open the `beta settings <https://control.divio.com/account/change-beta-testing/>`_,
* activate the `opt-in` checkbox and 
* hit Save. 


 You can confirm if beta features are `opted-in` `here <https://control.divio.com/account/contact/>`_. 
 

You can also opt-out any time following the same steps to deactivate the `opt-in` checkbox.

.. note::  
   Beta features are still on their final testing stage. Your feedback is appreciated.
