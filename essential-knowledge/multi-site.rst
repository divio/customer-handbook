Running multi-site applications
===============================

Divio offers flexible multi-site hosting.

A multi-site project serves multiple sites and domains within a single application. For example, an international
corporation may have a number of distinct country sites, each serving content in a particular set of languages.

Different options for multi-site applications on Divio are available depending on requirements.

Our mirror project functionality makes it possible for multiple sites to run the same code and share the same database
and storage, while each runs as an independent project instance. This is a powerful, flexible and scalable architecture
that allows sites to be allocated resources in a way that maximises efficiency.
