How to duplicate a project
==========================

To help you re-use work and speed up your workflow, Divio offers multiple options for project duplication - Copy, Fork and Mirror.

Select your duplication option
------------------------------

To duplicate a project, open its actions menu and select Duplicate.

You need to give the duplicate a name, and decide whether to duplicate the project to a different organisation.

From the *Copy type* select the appropriate duplication action, Copy, Fork or Mirror. Refer :ref:`here <three-way-duplicating-project>` for what each of these different ways of duplicating the project represents.

Select subscription options
---------------------------

After creating the duplicate, you will need to select a suitable subscription, there will be a separate billing.

Resources for the duplicate will be provided separately. The new duplicate has to have adequate resources allocated to it, and if it depends on additional backing services such as Celery workers should also be allocated.
