How to transfer a project to another organisation
=================================================

Projects can be moved to different organisations you belong to. 

To transfer a project to another organisation, first you must cancel its subscription via the Subscription view. A
project cannot be transferred while it has a subscription applied.

.. note:: For projects with business subscription only: 

    If you don't want to interrupt the subscription, please contact Divio support and we can transfer the project
    without any downtime for you.

Once the subscription has been cancelled, open the options menu in the project's dashboard and select Transfer.

or in the project view:

Then you can select the new organisation for the project.
